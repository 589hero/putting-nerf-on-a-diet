# Putting NeRF on a Diet: Semantically Consistent Few-Shot View Synthesis Implementation

the Pytorch, JAX based code imlementation of this paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00677
The model gives the 3D neural scene representation (NeRF: Neural Radiances Field) estimated from a few images. 
Which is based on extracting the semantic information using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer

Our Project is started in the HuggingFace X GoogleAI (JAX) Community Week Event.
